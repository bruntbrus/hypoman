<h2>MyDesktop</h2>
<p>
	Welcome to your own virtual desktop online! Run applications in dynamic
	frames inside the page itself. Navigate easily using the side panel with
	collapsable sections. Enjoy smooth transitions for an enhanced experience.
</p>
<p>
	Work is in progress. It's possible to run custom applications in external
	files written for this desktop. Experiment with different settings in the
	leftmost input form. Try different features when creating frames.
	Transition settings needs to be tuned depending on your machine and browser.
</p>
<p>
	All code is written by me from the ground up. I've tested it on every major
	browser: Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari
	and Opera. I had a hard time making it work in Internet Explorer. This is
	basically an ambitious effort to learn much about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
	In the next stage my ambition is to learn more about PHP, MySQL and AJAX.
